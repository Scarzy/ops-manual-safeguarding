# Fundraising Team

## Purpose

The Fundraising Team is a Services team responsible for sourcing funding for the current and following SR Competition cycle.

This includes, but is not limited to:
* Secure funding for the current and future competition year
* Sourcing Sponsorship
* Fundraising
* Industry links & relationship management

## Structure and Operation

The Fundraising Team is a group of volunteers who work together, and closely with other teams within SR, to ensure there is sufficient funding for the teams to operate. The team is lead by a committee that is responsible for fulfilling the aims of the team.

The team operates continuosly (see [Formation and Dissolution](committee-involvement.md)).

Volunteers apply through the Fundraising Team Committee to join the team. The committee will ensure the team has an appropriate balance of relevant skills. Volunteers will be encouraged to apply at the start of each competition cycle but can apply at any time. The committee should not unreasonably restrict membership of the team.

## The Committee
Unlike the other teams, the Fundraising Team committee is the Trustees. This is due to most sponsor applications requiring Trustee involvement anyway, and any decisions around sponsor suitability have to be made at Trustee level, so a separate committee would not be able to make any meaninful decisions.

## Roles and Responsibilities

In addition to the [common responsibilities](./common-responsibilities.md), the team has the following responsibilities:

### Accountability

The Competition Team is accountable to the Trustees. The committee member responsible for reporting to the Trustees will speak in person with the Trustees at least once every month to report on progress and to highlight any areas of concern. 

Minutes of meetings should be made available to the general public although access to any sensitive commercial data, may be restricted to the Trustees.

### Budget

A budget will be made available to aid in sourcing funding. The responsibility for this budget will be delegated to an individual committee member.
