# DBS Checks

Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks, formerly known as CRB checks, are where a person's records are checked to identify past criminal activity, which may present issues for another role.
DBS checks are a vital part of the safeguarding process.

## Types of check

There are various levels of DBS check, and different roles may require different levels of check.
For most roles within Student Robotics, a DBS check is not required.
However volunteers in roles with greater exposure to young people may be required to undergo a DBS check. Volunteers will be notified by the Safeguarding Lead if a role they are undertaking requires a DBS check.

## DBS Checks from other roles

If you have a DBS check for another organisation, it may or may not be possible to consider it for use with Student Robotics.
Please contact the Safeguarding Lead to see if this applies.
